The parents of the 14-year-old, whose name is being withheld by ABC News because she was charged as a juvenile, describe their daughter as a lovable, caring girl. And, they say, as parents of seven children, they pride themselves on being involved in their kids' lives. Polk Co. Sheriff Grady Judd said he charged the 14-year-old and a second girl, 12, because they showed a lack of remorse. Judd pointed to a Facebook post allegedly made by the 14-year-old that says, ""Yes, I bullied Rebecca and she killed herself but I don't give a f---,"" which the girl's parents blame on a Facebook hack. The 12-year-old was released to her parents' custody and has made some claims of remorse.

The state-run reform school opened in 1900 and closed in 2011 for budget reasons, though allegations of rape, torture, beating and murder of child inmates were nearly constant through its history. Child remains will be examined and DNA-tested to try to determine who was buried there and why they died. Formerly called the Florida School for Boys, it was once the largest juvenile reform institute in the United States, intended for 13 to 21-year-olds, though the two bodies found are thought to be as young as 10. The school has had a long and disgraceful history; Dr. Kimmerle said she became interested in the investigation because no records were kept of who died and were buried there, highly unusual for a state institution.

In 1994 when zoo keepers became concerned about his repetitive swimming pattern, they developed a program to keep his mind and body more active, such as having Gus forage for food. He also became a symbol for polar bears in the wild.

Veterinarians euthanized Gus on Tuesday after discovering a large, inoperable tumor in his thyroid region. His mate, Ida, died of liver disease at age 25 in 2011.

One was a veteran war photographer and the other a Liberian soldier who had dropped out of school in the 10th grade to go to war. Their lives couldn't have been more different, save for a fleeting moment in July 2003 when an iconic image tied them together forever. 

The image of Duo frozen in midair, drunk in the glory of war, became not only an iconic reminder of the deadly conflict in Liberia, but one of the most important images in modern war photography and a finalist for the 2004 Pulitzer Prize.

The story behind that photograph—and the subsequent friendship between Hondros and Duo—is the backbone of a documentary journalist Greg Campbell hopes to make about Hondros. Campbell, the author of ""Blood Diamonds"" and Hondros' best friend, launched a Kickstarter campaign this week to fund ""Hondros: A Life in Frames,"" which will explore the photographer's life by telling the stories behind some of his most famous photos.

Ligers occur, at least in this time in history, only in captivity, since the habitats of these animals no longer cross in the wild. Ligers inherit behaviors from both species -- like tigers, they like to swim, and like lions, tend to be sociable. And as evidenced by the birth of these cats, ligers can reproduce.

His father was a hard man, a disciplinarian. At two, a dresser fell on him, causing a concussion. By middle school, epilepsy forced him off the football team. Hitting his teens, he idolized his cousin Miguel, a Vietnam vet fond of showing him pictures of women he raped, tortured and killed there. When Miguel shot and killed his wife, Ricardo saw it happen and was spattered with her blood. By 18 he was building up a rap sheet full of robberies, rapes and drug busts and drifted into the Church of Satan. In April 1984 he killed a 9-year-old girl, and didn't stop killing, raping and robbing until fall 1985 when police had to save him from an angry east L.A. mob in the process of beating him to death after recognizing him from mug shots in the press. What followed was one of the longest, most expensive trials in U.S. history. At its end, Richard Ramirez, known as ""the Night Stalker"" for his murderous modus operandi, was found guilty of 13 counts of murder, 5 attempted murders, 11 sexual assaults and 14 burglaries. Sentenced to death, Ramirez ran out of appeals in 2006 and never got off death row. The Night Stalker died today in prison, aged 53.

In this wide-ranging interview, which talks about President Obama's drone and counterterrorism policies, Scahill reveals he became close to the family of Anwar Al-Awlaki (pictured), the U.S. citizen killed during an American drone strike in Yemen in 2011, and whose teenage son was killed shortly after. Scahill says he found al-Awlaki ""reprehensible,"" but that his family did not raise him to preach violent jihad and did not subscribe to his beliefs. Scahill, who has reported from Yemen, Afghanistan and Somalia, says he thinks the Guantanamo Bay prison should be a symbol of shame to Americans. Though no ideological soulmate to conservatives, Scahill says he admires Rand Paul's filibuster on the nomination of John Brennan to the CIA directorship as a sincere act--in contrast to the majority of Republicans, he says, who don't ""give a rat's ass to what happened to Anwar al-Awlaki,"" and take a racist view of Obama and Muslims. U.S. counterterrorism policy, he says, may be creating new terrorists abroad and may spawn more domestic terrorist acts, but in reality the U.S. is expending too much energy and resources on a relatively minor threat.

The U.S. State Department describes Rehman as ""the TTP's chief military strategist"" who ""led several attacks against U.S., NATO and Pakistani forces on either side of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border."" Pakistan's newly elected leader, cricket-player-turned-politician Imran Khan, condemned the drone attack on Twitter. If Rehman is dead, it's not clear what the long-term effects might be on the Pakistani Taliban, as leaders are often quickly replaced, and the organization is divided in itself, with infighting between member clans frequent.

Chinese hackers have compromised the designs of some of the most advanced weapons systems in the U.S. arsenal (Pictured is a Chinese J-20 stealth fighter, difficult to tell apart from a U.S. F-35). A Pentagon analysis by the Defense Science Board, reported in the Washington Post, says the compromised systems include drone video, laser and ""directed energy"" weapons, the V-22 Osprey, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, F/A-18 Hornet fighters flown by the Navy and Marines, and more. The report does not accuse China's government of stealing the designs, but, reports Olivier Knox, it's likely to be a topic of discussion 10 days from now when President Obama meets in California with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time.

As both have grown, says Joseph, who talked to Yahoo! News' Chris Moody, his path evolved from hippie to Republican activist. He worked for evangelical leader Pat Robertson's presidential campaign, as his disagreement with the Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion drove him powerfully to the political right. But that changed over time.

Not established: Was the killing planned in a jealous rage or a spontaneous act of self-defense?
