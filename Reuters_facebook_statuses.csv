In this photo from February 2013, Ronnie Chambers Jr. looks at his mother Tahitah Myles (obscured) during the funeral for his father Ronnie Chambers, 33, a victim of gun violence, in Chicago. This picture is one of 93 images we included in our top pictures of the year. 

Photographer John Gress writes about his experience that day: ""It's not every day that an assignment teaches you something about your own childhood. When I was seven years, old my father, who shared my name, passed away and when I looked down today, I saw a boy, Ronnie Chambers Jr., who is about the same age as I was back then, sitting at my feet with RIP carved in the back of his hair. He was there mourning the loss of his father, who also shared his name. 

""Ronnie Chambers was shot in the head on January 26. His mother Shirley Chambers has lost all four of her children to gun violence. Seeing Ronnie Jr. caused me to choke up a little, thinking about the parallels between his life and mine. Seeing him move about the church, seemingly unaware of the gravity of the situation, explained to me in that moment why all I can recall about my father's funeral was sitting in my uncle's lap during the service, and a photo of my father in his casket that my mother used to keep in the glove box of her car. 

""For me, as significant as that day was, to a child it wasn't much different than many other church experiences we have while navigating through the adult world. The situation was already emotional for me having met Ms. Chambers last week during an interview.

The concern over who had rights to Bolivia's natural gas resulted in the resignation of the then-president and the rise to power of now-President Evo Morales, who nationalized Bolivia's natural gas industry in 2006. 

Industry analysts criticized Morales, saying his leftist policies drove away private investment that funded natural gas exploration. Supporters say Morales has protected the country's indigenous groups and resource sovereignty. 
 
Bolivia's political trials left an unquestionable mark on politics in the Americas. Today, countries in both Central and South America continue to debate over the role of protecting natural resources and indigenous rights, with the Gas War not far away in memory.

The number of refugees stood at about 200,000 just a year ago, so the tide of men, women and children crossing borders has risen almost 10-fold over the past 12 months, figures from the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR showed.

Ongoing live coverage: http://reut.rs/14jsGrg

The deadly attacks in and around Damascus occurred on August 21, and reportedly killed more than 1,400 people, including more than 400 children, according to U.S. intelligence findings. The United Nations is still investigating the exact nature and type of weapons that were used, but their investigation would not determine who used them. 

Earlier this past week, Britain's House of Commons struck down a key vote that would have allowed Prime Minister David Cameron to pursue future military actions. In his statement on Saturday, Obama referenced this vote, which may have in some way influenced his decision to pursue congressional favor in the U.S.

The marches began with a protest in Sao Paulo against a small increase in bus and subway fares. 

The demonstrations drew the scorn of many middle-class Brazilians after protesters vandalized storefronts, subway stations and buses on one of the city's main avenues, but the movement gained support and spread to other cities as police used heavy-handed tactics to try to quell the demonstrations. The biggest crackdown happened on Thursday in Sao Paulo when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas in clashes that injured more than 100 people, including 15 journalists, some of whom said they were deliberately targeted.

The harsh police reaction to last week's protests touched a nerve in Brazil.

Tan-awan, in the southern Philippines island of Cebu, used to be a sleepy village that never saw tourists unless they were lost or in transit. Yet now they flock there by the hundreds - to swim with whale sharks, the world's largest fish. 

Whale sharks are lured to the Tan-awan coastline of the Oslob district by fishermen who hand feed them small shrimp, drawing divers and snorkelers to see the highly sought-after animals, known as gentle giants of the sea. But the practice has sparked fierce debate on the internet and among biologists, who decry it as unnatural.

Bees at a cluster of apiaries in northeastern France have been producing honey in mysterious shades of blue and green, alarming their keepers who now believe residue from containers of M&M's candy processed at a nearby biogas plant is the cause.

Since August, beekeepers around the town of Ribeauville in the region of Alsace have seen bees returning to their hives carrying unidentified colorful substances that have turned their honey unnatural shades.

Mystified, the beekeepers embarked on an investigation and discovered that a biogas plant 4 km (2.5 miles) away has been processing waste from a Mars plant producing M&M's, bite-sized candies in bright red, blue, green, yellow and brown shells.

Asked about the issue, Mars had no immediate comment.

Tuesday, 8 a.m. ET

Reuters Global Editor-at-Large Chrystia Freeland invites you to participate in the first-ever live debate between two of the most influential economists of the past decade, and possibly the next: Laura Tyson, a candidate to replace Larry Summers to be President Barack Obama's top economic advisor or to head the new Office of Financial Research, and former Chairman of President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers; and Glenn Hubbard, who held that same position under President George W. Bush. 


Afterward, Freeland referees a first-ever live video debate with two of the most influential and widely followed political commentators on YouTube, progressive Cenk Uyger and conservative Lee Doren. They will deconstruct the Tyson/Hubbard conversation as well as the profound economic challenges and policy positions dominating the upcoming midterm Congressional elections, which could change the political balance in Congress and have major impact the U.S. and the global economy. 
During the first part of the show, Cenk and Lee will live blog their thoughts.

Combined, this two-part debate, produced by Reuters at its headquarters in the heart of Times Square and featured on Reuters.com and Youtube.com, will provide distinctive analysis in an unprecedented forum of the election's major issue: the economy.
Join us on Tuesday at 8am ET to participate in the live event, then come back later for edited highlights and further commentary.",Chrystia Freeland,link,http://live.reuters.com/Event/Chrystia_Freeland,2010-10-10 08:01:01,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
