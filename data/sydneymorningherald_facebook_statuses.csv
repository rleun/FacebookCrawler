When the national broadband network is complete there will be no excuse whatsoever for daily mail deliveries. Australia's really remote locations are already limited to two deliveries per week. That should become the standard for the rest of us, as a precursor to eliminating local deliveries.

Alan James, OAM, was a close friend of Mr Yunupingu, the Yothu Yindi band leader and indigenous educator who died almost four weeks ago of kidney disease, aged only 56. James was the band's manager and a friend for 28 years. He recalled on Saturday how he met the man who he says brought black and white Australia together like no other.

A state memorial for Mr Yunupingu will be held on sacred Aboriginal land on Sunday at Gulkula, a one-time space tracking station near Nhulunbuy (Gove) in East Arnhem Land.

James was touring Aboriginal performance groups around Northern Territory schools when that first introduction came. At Yirrkala Community School, where Mr Yunupingu would later become the nation's first Aboriginal principal, he sought out James when he heard he was coming.

""He said 'hop in.' So I got in his short wheel base Toyota and we drove out to where he was living and sat on the beach and he played me five songs on the guitar and that was that. We shook hands and nearly 30 years later here we are.""

Yothu Yindi – meaning child and mother – were top ten worldwide in 1991 with the song Treaty, co-written by Paul Kelly. They performed at the United Nations in New York in 1992 for the International Year of Indigenous Peoples. In 2000 they closed the Sydney Olympics. The following year Treaty was named in the top 30 Australian songs of all time.

Mr Yunupingu, the singer and guitarist, was the first Aboriginal from Arnhem Land to get a university degree. He was named Australian of the Year in 1993, was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and helped set up the Yothu Yindi foundation, a cultural and education centre for his Yolngu people.

Mr Rudd also warned that a Coalition government could plunge Australia into recession if it adopted the harsh spending cuts he believes the opposition is planning.

He also signalled significant policy changes, including the possible dumping of the carbon tax in favour of a lower floating carbon price and a two-week extension of the negotiation period of the education funding package, and softened his language on a big Australia in favour of a sustainable Australia.

The supply chain that ends with customers at a Western department store and begins with Forhad at his sewing machine is complex and clandestine. But all along its length there is pressure, of those above pushing down on those below: customers expect bargains in a competitive retail world; retailers demand ever-lower prices from suppliers; suppliers connive for fractions of a cent off each garment made, on pain of pulling their orders from factory owners; and factory owners hold wages at worldwide lows and force unpaid overtime on their powerless, expendable workers.

Natural gas emits only half as much CO2 as coal, and occupies a rapidly increasing share of electricity generation – up 37 per cent since 2007, while coal's share has plummeted by 25 per cent. Indeed, natural gas has drawn close to coal as the number one source of US power. Natural gas use also improves local air quality and has economic and political benefits by way of job creation and reduced dependency on Middle East oil.

Yet environmentalists are overwhelmingly opposed to fracking for reasons of safety, an aversion to reliance on fossil fuels and the ""precautionary principle"" of avoiding unknown risks. None of these arguments is persuasive, writes Professor Frankel.

A key border crossing between North Korea and China has been closed to tourist groups, a Chinese official says, as nuclear tensions mounted, but business travel was allowed to continue. 

On Tuesday, Pyongyang advised foreigners to consider leaving South Korea, warning that the Korean peninsula was headed for ""thermo-nuclear"" war.

Last week, North Korean authorities also warned embassies in Pyongyang to consider evacuating as it would be unable to guarantee diplomats' safety in the event of conflict, but the statement was largely dismissed as empty rhetoric.

Test-based accountability provides too many incentives for officials, principals and teachers to rig results. This was highlighted by the indictment last month of the former US national Superintendent of the Year Beverley Hall on racketeering charges. Hall was charged, along with 34 other school administrators, principals and teachers, for cheating and manipulating test scores. 

In 2009, Hall was lauded for turning the Atlanta school system ''into a model of urban school reform''. The improvements proved to be phoney. The indictment alleges Hall and the others cheated on state tests, hid the cheating, and retaliated against whistleblowers.

The president of NSW Schools Rugby Union, Colin Murray, said over the past 12 months there had been more consideration given to the idea of weight categories, particularly for players under 16, to allay fears about the increasing size of some young football players and the physical risks associated with collisions on the field.

''The players these days are more powerful, generally speaking, and the physique of the younger generation has changed,'' said Mr Murray, who has been involved in school rugby for about 40 years.

Did Telstra think to, oh, I don't know, telephone me, to ask what was going on? Of course not, it just kept sending bills to the wrong address. So the postman told me when he saw me, and I called Telstra. That's when things really went downhill. Read more: http://ow.ly/jGNzm

Susan Patton, a Princeton graduate and mother of two sons at Princeton crashed the Daily Princetonian website and caused a media furor in the US over her ""Advice for the young women of Princeton: the daughters I never had"". In her article, Patton counselled Princeton's female students to: ""Forget about having it all, or not having it all, leaning in or leaning out - here's what you really need to know that nobody is telling you ... Find a husband on campus before you graduate.""

Other gems from her op-ed included:

""For most of you, the cornerstone of your future and happiness will be inextricably linked to the man you marry, and you will never again have this concentration of men who are worthy of you.

""I am the mother of two sons who are both Princetonians. My older son had the good judgment and great fortune to marry a classmate of his, but he could have married anyone. My younger son is a junior and the universe of women he can marry is limitless. Men regularly marry women who are younger, less intelligent, less educated. It's amazing how forgiving men can be about a woman's lack of erudition, if she is exceptionally pretty. Smart women can't (shouldn't) marry men who aren't at least their intellectual equal. As Princeton women, we have almost priced ourselves out of the market. Simply put, there is a very limited population of men who are as smart or smarter than we are. And I say again — you will never again be surrounded by this concentration of men who are worthy of you.""

Deaths in Thailand were largely due to illness or accident, while most deaths in Greece were from what the Department of Foreign Affairs calls ''natural causes'', pointing to a much older group travelling there. 

These statistics underline a key finding of a new Lowy Institute report highlighting the increasing burden travellers are putting on consular staff abroad. Overseas travel by Australians has doubled in the past decade leading to many more older - and younger, inexperienced - tourists coming into strife abroad.

The report slams a growing sense of ""entitlement"" among travellers who expect the Australian government to not only come to the rescue but, in the case of one couple who was evacuated from Cairo on a government chartered rescue flight, provide frequent flyer points as well.

''We can get a blood test for it, but the digital examination is the only true way to get a correct reading on your prostate, so make sure you go and do that, and perhaps look for a small female Asian doctor is probably the best way,'' he said.

It also found that labels with only calorie information had little or no impact on people's behaviour: http://ow.ly/f7b4f. 

Do you think people would be less likely to eat junk food if its label stated how much exercise it would take to burn it off? Do you think there's a need to reduce the amount of junk food we eat, or should it be up to the individual to make their own health decisions?

As right-wing pundits attacked him and his ""voodoo statistics"" for failing to see that the election was on a knife edge – and in the case of some conservative wingnuts, for being openly gay and ""effeminate"" – Silver held his nerve and for the entire election cycle maintained that the data always pointed to an easy Obama victory.
