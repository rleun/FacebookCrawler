That question will be argued in British Columbia's Supreme Court next year, but meanwhile, a group of up to 150 addicts are awaiting their first free, supervised  heroin injections in a controversial West Coast program. The heroin is supposed to arrive in BC in early December.  It's called heroin maintenance, and medical professions with a group called Providence Health Care say it's the best treatment for addicts who don't respond to other treatments. Providence got a court injunction to operate this temporary program, over the objections of the Harper government. Even though heroin is now legally administered to addicts in five European countries, Canada's Health Minister Rona Ambrose says it's a mistake because heroin is a dangerous drug, and that handing it out would it create a ""throw-away"" group of citizens. On the other hand, supporters of the program say such a program would reduce crime and health costs, prevent fatal overdoses, and save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It could also help people like Kevin. http://glbn.ca/EyRjF",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/GlobalNews/photos/a.135330923181348.20713.114019975312443/745756785472089/?type=3,2014-11-19 23:25:06,288,604,287,288,0,0,0,0,0
