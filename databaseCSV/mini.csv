,XinhuaNewsAgency
The amount of pollutants discharged in Beijing last year was much greater than its environment could handle, with PM 2.5 in particular exceeding standards, according to an annual environmental report released on Thursday.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
Despite its efforts to curb pollution, the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau said in the report that the quality of the capital's environment in 2013 remained almost the same as that of the previous year.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
Based on the six pollutants monitored last year, the air quality of 176 days was classified as ""fine,"" only accounting for 48.2 percent of the whole year, said Zhang Dawei, director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center.,XinhuaNewsAgency
,XinhuaNewsAgency
POLLUTION,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
The report shows that Beijing's average PM2.5 (airborne particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter) index stood at 89.5 micrograms per cubic meter in 2013, exceeding the new national standard for fine air by 156 percent.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
The average index readings of nitrogen dioxide and PM 10 were 56 and 108.1 micrograms per cubic meter, exceeding the national standards by 40 and 54 percent respectively. The daily maximum eight-hour average ozone concentration exceeded the standard by 14.6 percent.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
Among all the six pollutants monitored in the city, only the index for sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide met the standards last year.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
Liu Xianshu, director of the environmental monitoring department of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, said there is a gap between air quality in the southern and northern parts of the city.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
""The average PM2.5 index monitored in the north was 60.3 micrograms per cubic meter last year, while it stood at 116.3 micrograms per cubic meter in the south, about twice the amount of the north,"" Liu said.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
According to the report, Beijing failed to address its shortage of water resources and the severe pollution of downstream sections of the capital's rivers.,XinhuaNewsAgency

To improve the environment, China must drop a GDP-oriented development model and take its environmental capacities into consideration when making economic development plans, said Zhong Maochu, a professor at Nankai University in Tianjin Municipality.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
That is particularly true for Beijing right now, as the city streamlines its industrial structure.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
The municipal commission of development and reform confirmed with Xinhua on Thursday that it has not yet made a list of the ""most energy-consuming and highly polluting"" enterprises to be relocated to neighboring cities.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
However, it does encourage enterprises to improve their pollution control facilities to ensure they can remain in Beijing, said a commission official who is familiar with the situation.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
""Beijing has paid a remarkable environmental cost for pollution.Considering Beijing's role in the country, the removal of polluters from the city is inevitable,"" said Niu Fengrui, a researcher with the Institute for Urban and Environmental Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
The government, however, should take more measures to encourage enterprises to upgrade their production technologies to reduce pollutant emissions and to lessen energy consumption voluntarily, said Niu.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
""Financial support for the key enterprises is a good way of doing this,"" said the researcher.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
Beijing published a guideline in 2007 on the management of polluting enterprises, vowing to close or remove all small plants processing concrete, paper, chemicals, casting products, printing and dyeing products, electroplate products, and plate glass.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
The city plans to either close or upgrade 300 highly polluting enterprises in 2014, and the number is expected to reach 1,200 by the end of 2016, when annual industrial coal consumption will be reduced by 2 million tonnes annually, the commission added.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
A set of measures was already rolled out in 2013 to tackle Beijing's environmental problems.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
In September, the local government unveiled a five-year plan (2013- 2017) to improve air quality through means including slashing coal consumption, promoting clean energy use and reducing production capacities with heavy pollution.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
That followed a three-year plan (2013-2015) being issued last May to improve Beijing's waste water treatment and promote the construction of water recycling facilities.,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
According to the environmental protection bureau, last year saw 44,000 households in downtown Beijing bid farewell to coal-fired stoves and start to use electrical heaters. ,XinhuaNewsAgency
   ,XinhuaNewsAgency
The city also replaced 366,000 high-emission vehicles with new ones and raised environmental standards for enterprises. The construction of highly polluting and energy-intensive facilities was forbidden, and fines for emissions of major pollutants were raised.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/photos/a.338115926215858.90546.338109312883186/811526795541433/?type=3,4/10/2014 7:00,850,5,1,850,0,0,0,0,0,XinhuaNewsAgency

 WINDOW ROCK - The White Cone Chapter is spearheading an effort to create a tribal constitution by holding a gathering of grassroots Navajos at the chapter's community building on Saturday.,navajotimes
 The event is set for 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and will be co-sponsored by Diné Biziil, a reservation-wide grassroots organization. Lunch will be provided.,navajotimes
 Norman Brown, co-founder of Diné Bizill, said that although there have been unsuccessful efforts in the past to develop a tribal constitution, all of which went nowhere, he feels that the efforts this time will be successful because of the recent election of Russell Begaye as tribal president.,navajotimes
 Brown pointed out that Begaye supported the creation of a tribal constitution during his campaign as a way to unify the Navajo people and bring stability to the tribal government.,navajotimes
 He said he wants this gathering Saturday to start the groundwork for the development of a constitution and get people talking about what they would want in it.,navajotimes
 After this gathering, the plans are to hold other gatherings in major communities on the Navajo reservation to continue getting input. There are also plans to hold a rally during the July tribal council session in which grassroots Navajos from all four directions will come in on horseback to urge members of the council to lend their support to the effort.,navajotimes

223495844457800_472944496179599,"In an effort to strengthen economic and cultural links with central Asia and beyond, Chinese President Xi Jinping has put forward his concept for a New Silk Road Economic Belt. Some academics believe that concrete proposals like the Silk Road Economic Belt have linked China with these countries together in a community of shared destiny. One purpose of Premier Li Keqiang's current three-nation Eurasian trip is to transform the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, known shortly as the ""One Belt and One Road"" initiatives into reality. ,chinaplusnews
,chinaplusnews
Premier Li Keqiang arrived in Serbia late Monday after wrapping up a visit to Kazakhstan in his Eurasian trip, which will also take him to Thailand. He was to participate in a leaders' meeting of China and Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries and make an official visit to Serbia, where he is expected to attend a ceremony marking the completion of a Chinese-built bridge across River Danube in Belgrade.,chinaplusnews
,chinaplusnews
But Professor Ye Hailin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences urges observers to look at the importance of proposing such a concept rather than the concrete aspects of the project at such an early stage. ""This is a new type of doctrine for China to encourage cooperation with neighboring countries. We have seen that with the support of infrastructure building, China not only wants to build communication with the neighboring countries, it also wants to encourage its economic overseas presence by introducing some industrial complexes and trying to promote the Chinese companies' internationalization level, and also (by) trying to use Chinese FDI to make a balance between Chinese foreign trade and foreign investment. We know that most of the (neighboring) countries suffer a huge trade deficit in the bilateral relations with China. This is really difficult to change because China basically provides more industrialized products to the overseas market."",chinaplusnews
,chinaplusnews
Professor Shen Dingli, associate dean of International Studies at Fudan University has presented a broader view on the Silk Road Economy. He believes China needs to have a balanced economic development. So far China's southeast and east have caught up with the Asia Pacific economic development winds, so those areas participate more fully in that field of international cooperation and globalization and have boosted the Chinese economy. But that has also generated a problem: imbalanced domestic economic development. China needs to address this domestic imbalance by tapping its hinterland and also its remote bordering areas around Central Asian countries so as to fully develop their economic potential.  ,chinaplusnews
,chinaplusnews
Globally the European economic zone, the EU, has been integrating more members, now numbering 28, to lift the zone to a higher plateau. Central Asia and China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have been situated between Asia Pacific economic ring and also European EU integration. So this middle belt, a vast territorial extension, has not fully achieved its own economic potential which makes the region imbalanced. Therefore, for neighboring countries' development, China needs to take a leadership role to initiate regional cooperation which would go beyond the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which attaches more importance to political and security dimensions. SCO needs to expand its economic scope. Professor Shen believes that this is an area with vast territory; not enough people; vast energy; and a great potential for agriculture, but no great industries except for those energy industries. People are not sufficiently linked due to the scarce population density and Central Asia's lack of funds required to build up their modern industries. So this is a feature of the region and a reality. And there is great potential for modern agriculture, modern connectivity through transport, modern telecommunications and modern finance. If these can be built up, each square kilometer can generate more wealth for Central Asian countries and for China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. China needs to show Central Asian countries the feasibility of the initiative and also shoulder the major financial responsibility because China will probably benefit greatly from building up such a modern Silk Road. ,chinaplusnews
,chinaplusnews
Professor Shen Dingli is confident that China's ""One Belt and One Road"" initiatives will help boost development in China's western regions, which has been rich in territory, energy and lots of other minerals, but not rich in water and in populations living in the area. Therefore, China needs to link its own domestic development to this Central Asian neighborhood development. Now China is doing a lot through its ""Go West"" movement. The country is developing its own hinterland; its own southwest including Chengdu, Chongqing. Globally these places are being viewed as China's next economic hub. And China is preparing Xi'an as an aviation center, an education center and the departing point of a new Eurasian railway. ,chinaplusnews

    Dean Baker, 21 November 2016 ,ceprDC
There are sharp differences between the political parties in many areas, but one principle on which there has been a longstanding agreement is that the presidency should not be used as a marketing platform for the president's personal business interests. Donald Trump seems determined to break with this principle.,ceprDC
The basic point is simple: when you enter the White House you put your assets into a blind trust. This way when the president makes decisions in various areas of foreign and domestic policy, he or she does not know whether they will personallly profit from them. The idea is that we want the president to make decisions based on whether they are good for the country, not whether they will fatten their pocketbook.,ceprDC
Presidents of both parties dating back to Lyndon Johnson followed the practice of putting their assets into a blind trust. Richard Nixon did it, Gerald Ford did it, as did Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama. Both President Bushes put their assets into a blind trust. And President Reagan put his assets into a blind trust.,ceprDC
None of these presidents had any problem with the idea that they should not be a position to know whether their actions were directly helping or hurting them financially. Apparently, Donald Trump thinks he is different.

,PeoplesDaily
A 4-year-old boy miraculously emerged with only minor injuries after he was run over by a car on May 4 in Nanchong, southwestern China's Sichuan province. ,PeoplesDaily
,PeoplesDaily
The surveillance video shows the boy letting go of his mother's hand as they walked together on the crosswalk. The little boy then ran across the street at the very moment that a car began to turn right, knocking the boy to the ground and driving over his chest. The mother rushed up and tried to push the car aside with her body, but the boy independently crawled out from under the car several minutes later. ,PeoplesDaily
,PeoplesDaily
He was then rushed to the hospital, though he appeared to have suffered only some scratches on his forehead and several soft-tissue injuries. ,PeoplesDaily
,PeoplesDaily
But how could such a small child be run over and suffer only minor injuries?,PeoplesDaily
,PeoplesDaily
""The car was preparing to turn right so its speed was very slow. When it hit the boy, there was a clear sign of further slowing, which greatly eased the force of the impact,"" explained Mo Xinchun, a Nanchong police officer.,PeoplesDaily
,PeoplesDaily
Children's muscles and even skeletons are relatively soft and flexible, which could be another reason for the boy's miraculous lack of serious injury, said Wei Yun, a professor at Southwest Jiaotong University. Even so, this would not count as a normal case, admitted Wei. http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0511/c90000-9056068.html,PeoplesDaily

,CBSNews
In the end, it wasn't close. Barack Obama won re-election handily over Mitt Romney with 303 electoral votes, well more than the 270 electoral votes needed. Of the nine battleground states that were up for grabs, Obama won 7 of them, losing only North Carolina (Florida remains to be called). But while Obama won those states, he didn't crush it; he won instead, a string of precise narrow victories. He didn't win because his leadership during Hurricane Sandy blew all those swing votes his way (though it may have helped). The president won because he ran a permanent campaign, keeping his offices open in the battleground states from his 2008 campaign, tending his coalition assiduously, and because he relentlessly defined his opponent. His was the better campaign. The Democratic candidate of ""hope and change"" beat the big business Republican in the trenches, in one state after another.,CBSNews

It was America's beloved pastime, baseball. The lamented Montreal Expos had come close, but in the fall of 1992 the Toronto Blue Jays went all the way. It seemed the entire country was tuning in to the late, great broadcaster Tom Cheek as the Jays first knocked off the Oakland A's - remember Roberto Alomar's homer off Dennis Eckersley? - and then, in Game 6 of the final against the Atlanta Braves, 41-year-old Dave Winfield struck a double in the 11th inning that gave the Jays a 4-3 victory. It marked the first time ever that the championship was celebrated outside U.S. borders. One year later, the Jays did it again. -- Roy MacGregor ,theglobeandmail

,pakistanPKaffairs
Some called it an artificial creation while others grieved on the vivisection of an ancient land. Yet, no one realized on that fateful night of 14th of August in 1947, that an ancient land has resurrected itself from the ashes of a lost civilization. That night the people of Meluhha came to life again as Pakistan. It was celebrated as an emergence of a new nation on the world map, least realizing that with minor differences in boundaries, the map which housed the people of Meluhha for over 9000 years, simply reclaimed its heritage as Pakistan. Meluhha were the people of Indus Valley Civilization.,pakistanPKaffairs
,pakistanPKaffairs
The sub-continent has geographically been divided into two major regions since thousands of years; the Indus Valley with its tributaries and the Ganges Valley with its tributaries, separated by the watershed created by Gurdaspur-Kathiawar Salient. The maps of these two regions roughly align with the maps of present day Pakistan and India.,pakistanPKaffairs
,pakistanPKaffairs
Historically also these two regions have remained separate entities for most part of known history. The only period when these two regions even remained as one political unit in over 9000 years of known history, were during the era of Mauryan, Muslim and British rule. The major historic difference between the two regions was that while the people of Indus Valley created one of the oldest unified civilizations of the world and those of Ganges Valley remained separated and segregated. The Two Nations Theory which became one of the founding principles of creation of Pakistan and partition of British India in 1947, in historical hindsight, helped create status quo ante where history merely repeated itself.,pakistanPKaffairs

,theglobeandmail
Jean-Bedel Bokassa was no garden variety African despot. He seized power of the Central African Republic in 1966, calling himself President for Life. When he outgrew that title, he donned a crown encrusted with 2,000 diamonds, rubies and emeralds and proclaimed himself Emperor. His two-day coronation, including a golden eagle throne, cost $22-million, nearly bankrupting the country. Bokassa's tyrannical rule ended in 1979, when he was ousted in a coup and accused of clubbing to death schoolchildren who refused to wear uniforms made in a factory he owned. He became the first deposed African chief to be publicly tried for murder and convicted. In 2010, he was posthumously pardoned by President Francois Bozize. ''He was a builder,'' said JeanSerge Bokassa, his son. ''Unfortunately, the negative acts tarnished his image.'' -- Karen Howlett,theglobeandmail

New Issue Brief Shows that US Veto Power and Alliance of High-Income Countries Effectively Exclude World's Majority,ceprDC
April 15, 2016,ceprDC
,ceprDC
Washington, D.C. - A new issue brief from the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) shows that despite recent changes in voting shares, the U.S. and Europe continue to maintain control of decisions at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The brief, ""Voting Share Reform at the IMF: Will it Make a Difference?"" examines reforms to IMF governance enacted earlier this year and finds that with 16.73 percent of votes, the U.S. dwarfs all other member countries' voting shares, both before and after the latest changes, and that outside of Brazil, Russia, India and China, voting shares for the rest of the developing world have actually decreased by 3 percentage points.,ceprDC
""The shift of 2.35 percentage points to China is far too small to make any significant difference in how the organization is run,"" CEPR Co-Director, and co-author of the brief, Mark Weisbrot said today. ""Also, the U.S. importantly still has veto power over an array of major decisions.,ceprDC
""The IMF will continue to be dominated by the finance ministries of the rich countries, with U.S. Treasury at the top, and the governments of the vast majority of the world's people will have very little say."",ceprDC
The paper notes that this power imbalance can lead to damaging policies implemented in developing countries. For example, a review of 41 countries with IMF agreements during the world recession of 2009 found that 31 of the agreements contained pro-cyclical fiscal, monetary — or both — policy conditionalities [i.e., policies that could be expected to slow an economy that was already weakening or in recession].

Talk about potty humour gone wrong. Shortages - of gasoline, electricity, even onions - were the norm in 1973. So Johnny Carson couldn't resist joking about news that originated from a U.S. senator that a reduction in pulp paper could mean a shortage of toilet paper. ""You know, we've got all sorts of shortages these days,"" Carson told viewers. ""But have you heard the latest? I'm not kidding. I saw it in the papers. There's a shortage of toilet paper!""

,PeoplesDaily
The West and Russia heightened their fight against the Islamic State (IS) after the Paris attacks. Meanwhile, a Chinese hostage was killed by the IS and three Chinese employees died in the terror attack in Mali. In this circumstance, it has been often raised both domestically and globally as to whether #China will join other countries in combating the IS head-on.,PeoplesDaily
China's foreign ministry shunned a straightforward answer to the question, which is taken by many as also signifying China's attitude.,PeoplesDaily
It will be a significantly major policy decision if China sends troops to the Middle East or conducts precision attacks far away. Despite the West's high expectations for China's participation, the Chinese government will be extremely prudent in making such a decision.,PeoplesDaily
The West wants to take in China to jointly combat the IS since it remains the dominator in this respect. This can help China shape a positive image in international opinion and open up a new platform for China and the West over political communication and cooperation. But this may lead to a series of risks for China to bear, which can evolve into costs in reality. China has not been fully prepared for military operations. Not having engaged in battles for many years, China may find it hard to obtain full public support if its troops fight in the far away Middle East and more uncertainties will arise.,PeoplesDaily

109808052412959_752094648184293,"Arab states have entered into a secret pact to support Israel in its offensive in the Gaza Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hinted the Arab states want Israel to defeat Hamas. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Jordan and Egypt have been silent as the death toll in Gaza has soared above 1,800, and injuries have approached 10,000.,bignewsnetwork
,bignewsnetwork
Massive destruction has accompanied the casualties, which now exceed any of previous Israeli offensives. CNN commentators say requests for comments from Arab leaders and foreign ministers are being met with silence. None of the leaders of spokespeople for these countries that in the past have vented anger at Israeli actions, remain passively silent.,bignewsnetwork
,bignewsnetwork
Now Israel has let the cat out of the bag. Prime Minister Netanyahu has been speaking in recent days of demilitarization of Gaza, and in the past two days has introduced an element of rehabilitation to coincide with demilitarization.  In statements in the past 24 hours he has been stressing Israel has the support of the United States and the European Union, and has thanked them implicitly for accepting their version of how the 72-hour ceasefire on Saturday broke down.,bignewsnetwork
,bignewsnetwork
However for the first time in a statement made Sunday, Mr Netanyahu implied he has the backing of the Arab states, indicating their support may come as a surprise to others, but not to Israel.,bignewsnetwork
,bignewsnetwork
""We are enlisting the international community to support this goal of linking the rehabilitation and development of Gaza to its demilitarization but no less important – this may surprise many, but not us – is the unique link which has been forged with the states of the region,"" the Israeli prime minister said.  ""This as well is a very important asset for the state of Israel. With the cessation of the fighting and the conclusion of the campaign, this will open new possibilities for us."",bignewsnetwork
,bignewsnetwork
Only Qatar is not in the fold and this was made clear by the Israeli premier, when he accused Doha of complicity with Hamas in what he considered 'deceiving' the UN and the U.S. over the aborted ceasefire.,bignewsnetwork
,bignewsnetwork
""At this time it is clear what is happening here. Hamas wants the residents of Gaza to suffer and be hurt and thinks that the world will blame Israel for their suffering. There are many people in the world who understand exactly what Hamas is, the same organization that, together with Qatar, assured US Secretary of State John Kerry and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon regarding a ceasefire. It misled both of them,"" he said.,bignewsnetwork
,bignewsnetwork
Mr Netanyahu was effusive of President Obama and John Kerry's siding with Israel over the ceasefire violation, putting a positive light on what is being perceived as a strained relationship between the United States and Israel.,bignewsnetwork
,bignewsnetwork
""I welcome the clear and sharp statements by US President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Kerry, who placed the direct responsibility for violating the ceasefire on Hamas, and for President Obama's remarks last night regarding Israel's right to defend itself against rockets and tunnels,"" the Israeli prime minister said. ""Similar voices have been heard from other important leaders around the world."",bignewsnetwork
,bignewsnetwork
Arab leaders however remained silent publicly. News media outlets in the Gulf states too have toned down coverage of the current conflict in relation to past wars. Protests have been few and far between in the Arab world, with only the West Bank and Qatar voicing concern and support for Gaza.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/752094648184293/?type=3,8/4/2014 1:24,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,bignewsnetwork

109808052412959_555995501127543,"Bradley Manning faces life imprisonment as a military judge has refused to dismiss the most serious charge of ""aiding the enemy"" against the army private who leaked classified government documents to the whistleblower website Wikileaks. Manning, 25, has denied the charges saying he did not intend to benefit terrorist groups with the information that he gave Wikileaks but rather his intention was to spark a conversation about America's actions abroad. The judge's refusal to throw out the charge has, according to his lawyers, left a dangerous precedent for individuals who leak information to journalists and that it could affect more traditional news organizations. The government has argued that his actions, that led Wikileaks to publish the leaked information, in turn helped terror groups such as al-Qaeda. Manning's legal team counter-argues that he only shared the information to change US foreign policy. They said that the government had also failed to prove that the private had ""actual knowledge"" that he was providing intelligence to al-Qaeda. The trial at a military base in Maryland is drawing to a close.

12350395521_10153702977725522,"CEPR Co-Director Mark Weisbrot's latest Tribune Content Agency column begins: ""President Obama initiated a historic change when he decided last December to begin normalizing relations with Cuba. It was an acknowledgment that more than half a century of trying to topple the Cuban government, through invasion, assassination attempts, economic embargo, and other — mostly illegal — efforts had failed. It was also a concession to the majority of the hemisphere, which had informed Washington in 2012 that there would not be another Summit of the Americas without Cuba.,ceprDC
,ceprDC
""It was not necessarily a change in U.S. objectives, as a number of statements from the U.S. government indicate that the goal of normalizing relations and expanding commerce with Cuba is still ""regime change"" by other means. But it is nonetheless a major step forward, after the U.S. had been isolated in the entire world on this issue for decades, with repeated votes against the embargo at the U.N. general assembly — such as last year's tally of 188-2 (only Israel voted with the U.S.).,ceprDC
,ceprDC
""Last week, the Cuban government reiterated its position that in order for relations to be normalized, the U.S. must not only end the embargo but pay compensation for the damage that it has caused to Cuba and its people over the past 54 years. Cuban President Raúl Castro also reminded Washington that the Guantanamo prison and military base must be closed and the land returned to Cuba.,ceprDC
,ceprDC
""These are entirely reasonable requests from Cuba. The U.S. forced Cuba to accede to the military base in 1903, as well as grant permission to the United States to intervene in its internal affairs, as a condition of its ""independence."" Furthermore, even if one ignores the how the lease originated, it was granted for a naval and coaling station – not a prison. So the U.S. is violating the terms of the lease, just as if someone rented a residential apartment and used it to sell drugs.""

99543192159_10153735840527160,"#DCOPINION: Mystic Mantra: Sacred experience of sacrifice,deccannews
,deccannews
Id ul-zuha (feast of sacrifice), which marks the end of the Haj, Muslims' annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, is not just a ritual festival. Rather, this three-day-long occasion has a moving spiritual story of sacrifice, submission and supplication to God, evoking deep, humane emotions. It reminds us of our prime task of helping the needy and feeding the hungry. The observance of Id-ul-zuha has been enjoined to inculcate in us the spirit of love, compassion and caring for others.,deccannews
,deccannews
Going by the Islamic history, this Id is celebrated in remembrance of Prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son, Ismail, when God asked him to sacrifice the most precious thing to him. It was none other than his only beloved son whom Allah gifted to him after he spent sleepless nights in constant prayers, asking for a child. However, when Ibrahim had fully prepared to sacrifice his son, God put a sheep in his place. Prophet Ibrahim's infinite devotion and complete submission to the will of God are the core values that Muslims celebrate during Id-ul-zuha.,deccannews
,deccannews
Thus, they remind themselves of Prophet's willingness to sacrifice anything for the sake of God. Muslims sacrifice the halal animals in remembrance of Ibrahim's devotional sacrifice to God and distribute them to the poor and the less fortunate. However, animal sacrifice is not the core essence of this festival. The holy Quran relays that God does not actually take pleasure in flesh and blood: ""Their meat will not reach Allah, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is piety from you."",deccannews

Duke Kunshan University (DKU), a Sino-American joint venture university in east China's Jiangsu Province, will officially open in August, local authorities said Tuesday.,XinhuaNewsAgency
,XinhuaNewsAgency
DKU, in the city of Kunshan, was jointly created by U.S.-based Duke University and Wuhan University in Hubei Province. The Ministry of Education formally approved its establishment last September.,XinhuaNewsAgency
,XinhuaNewsAgency
""We plan to enroll the first cohort of 100 students, including 50 Chinese, offering master's degree programs in global health, medical physics and management studies. Graduates will be granted degrees from Duke University,"" said Liu Jingnan, chancellor of DKU.,XinhuaNewsAgency
,XinhuaNewsAgency
In addition to degree academic programs, the university will provide non-degree courses for undergraduate students. Students who successfully complete the program will receive Duke University course credit that can be transferred to other degree-granting institutions.,XinhuaNewsAgency
,XinhuaNewsAgency
According to Liu, currently about 20 Chinese universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University and Fudan University, have signed agreements with DKU to select excellent undergraduates to attend the non-degree program. Some of them have already received certificates of admission.,XinhuaNewsAgency
,XinhuaNewsAgency
Liu said Chinese students will need to pay between 240,000 yuan (about 39,000 U.S. dollars) and 300,000 yuan for a graduate degree from DKU. Although the cost is comparatively cheaper than studying overseas, it is still big money for most Chinese families.,XinhuaNewsAgency
,XinhuaNewsAgency
""But the university will offer scholarships and subsidies for students. Even those from poor families can enjoy the world-class educational resources here,"" Liu said.,XinhuaNewsAgency
,XinhuaNewsAgency
The campus will cover an area of about 1,200 mu (80 hectares) and accommodate up to 7,000 students. The three-phase project is expected to be completed by 2024 with an investment of nearly five billion yuan.,XinhuaNewsAgency

The Ebola outbreak that plagued several African countries in 2014 is slowing down and even coming to an end in certain nations, but the aftermath of the disease continues to devastate communities, particularly the many children who have been left without parents.,BuzzFeedNews
,BuzzFeedNews
Ebola in Africa has orphaned thousands. Mid-December estimates by UNICEF showed that about 11,000 children had lost parents to Ebola in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia alone, a spokesperson for the organization confirmed to BuzzFeed News.,BuzzFeedNews
,BuzzFeedNews
In one Liberian village, every mother has been reportedly killed by the Ebola virus, The Telegraph reported.,BuzzFeedNews
,BuzzFeedNews
Ebola kills women in far greater numbers, as BuzzFeed News previously reported, largely due to the expectation that mothers and women care for the sick and bury the dead. In August, a Liberian health official estimated that 75% of Ebola deaths were women.,BuzzFeedNews
,BuzzFeedNews
In one Liberian village called Joeblow, a man reportedly carried in Ebola and shortly after transferred it to his wife. Fourteen other mothers in the town took care of the victim and eventually helped bury her. Soon after, they all got Ebola and died. Fifteen children were left motherless, The Telegraph reported.,BuzzFeedNews
,BuzzFeedNews
""It's now a village of no mothers and very confused children with blank looks on their faces,"" said one British aid worker.,BuzzFeedNews
,BuzzFeedNews
""Although it feels like Liberia is coming out of the end of the crisis, it is now dealing with the aftermath, and what it has left behind is huge groups of children who are on their own. … When we visited Joeblow, it seemed normal at first … But then we realized there were no other women anywhere."",BuzzFeedNews
,BuzzFeedNews

FARMINGTON – Ashlynne Mike's little white casket was placed in the center of the Farmington Civic Center stage Friday morning surrounded with colorful, bright flowers.,navajotimes
,navajotimes
With a slide show of pictures of her playing the xylophone, as well as her artwork she had drawn, her family stood up and spoke about their unique and talented daughter and sister.,navajotimes
,navajotimes
 ""How do I begin a farewell, when I still can't believe you're gone,"" said Pamela Foster as she gave her daughter's eulogy. ""Our little Angel, whose life was short-lived. However, her beauty and magic will linger forever in our hearts and in those for whom she's touched."",navajotimes
,navajotimes
 Before the beginning of the services it was announced that there were 3,000 people waiting outside wanting to attend the service. Since it was first reported of Ashlynne's abduction Monday, there had been a widespread support throughout the Navajo Nation and New Mexico to help find her. When it was reported Ashlynne's body was found not far from the Shiprock Pinnacle the next day, an even greater amount of support came together to show their grief and outrage.,navajotimes
,navajotimes
 ""I'm heartbroken as I stand here today,"" said New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez who spoke at Ashlynne's funeral. ""The many people who loved Ashlynne described her as fun loving and always smiling. She was kind and quiet. She would've gone on to make a much better place."",navajotimes
,navajotimes
 Ashlynne's untimely, tragic death had sparked the conversation as to why the Navajo Nation lacks an Amber Alert system that could've possibly help locate her a lot sooner after she and her younger brother Ian Mike were abducted. ,navajotimes
,navajotimes
 Tom Begaye Jr., 27, of Waterflow, N.M., was later arrested in connection with the abduction.,navajotimes
,navajotimes
 As he spoke about his little sister, Ryan Begay said when he heard about Ashlynne's disappearance he drove to the Shiprock Pinnacle with a friend and searched for her. He said he had reported Ashlynne's disappearance at 10:30 p.m. but the alert didn't go out until 2:30 a.m. the next morning.,navajotimes
,navajotimes
 ""I wish this alert went out sooner when I called it,"" said Ryan Begay. ""That night I heard she was kidnapped, I spent a long time at the pinnacle driving late at night. I needed help. I thought that there would be a lot more people out there."",navajotimes
,navajotimes
 Aside from the family's disappointment in the lack of response from authorities they also spoke emotionally on the kind of little girl Ashlynne was. Her older sister Brittany Begay, said Ashlynne was a talented artist. ,navajotimes
,navajotimes
It was mentioned how much the fifth-grade student from Ojo Amarillo Elementary loved playing the xylophone and piano, and was a gifted student having made student of the month numerous of times and had near perfect attendance.,navajotimes
,navajotimes
 ""She was such a sweet, funny little sister,"" said Brittany. ""She was so creative. She would sit by me and watch me as I draw and try to mimic it…sometimes I would get our art work confused because she was that good.""",Photos from Navajo Times's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/navajotimes/photos/a.10151854197081233.1073741825.147969681232/10154001999121233/?type=3,5/6/2016 16:21,12157,591,2902,8457,664,4,5,3007,20,navajotimes

David Karoly, Professor of Atmospheric Science at the University of Melbourne, responds to Maurice Newman, who has made headlines around the world with his claim that Australia ""has become hostage to climate change madness"". Here's the piece http://ow.ly/sc9jn or you can read it below in full.,theageAustralia
,theageAustralia
-----------------,theageAustralia
By David Karoly,theageAustralia
,theageAustralia
Maurice Newman is chairman of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council. He must have thought that December 31 was April Fool's Day when he wrote an opinion piece in The Australian headed ""Crowds go cold on climate cost"".,theageAustralia
,theageAustralia
He once again revealed his opinions on climate change science when he wrote ""the scientific delusion, the religion behind the climate crusade, is crumbling"" and ""Australia, too, has become hostage to climate change madness"".,theageAustralia
,theageAustralia
His piece is a mix of common climate change myths, misinformation and ideology. While Mr Newman is welcome to his opinions, his writing reveals his sad misunderstanding of the facts about climate change.,theageAustralia
,theageAustralia
As Upton Sinclair wrote, ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!"",theageAustralia
,theageAustralia
Fortunately, the Prime Minister Tony Abbott, the Minister for the Environment Greg Hunt and the Australian government say they accept the science of climate change, as do the Australian Labor Party and the Greens.,theageAustralia
,theageAustralia
The key conclusions on climate change science from the Australian Academy of Science, the Royal Society of London and the US National Academy of Science have been confirmed with even greater confidence by the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released in September 2013.,theageAustralia
,theageAustralia
They include:,theageAustralia
,theageAustralia
There is no doubt that the climate system has warmed over the past 100 years and continues to warm.,theageAustralia
,theageAustralia
It is beyond reasonable doubt that human influences, through burning fossil fuels, industrial activity and land clearing, have been the main cause of the observed global warming since the mid 20th century.,theageAustralia
,theageAustralia
Continued emissions of greenhouse gases from human activity will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system.,theageAustralia
,theageAustralia
Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.,theageAustralia
,theageAustralia
Mr Newman writes that ""global temperatures have gone nowhere for 17 years"", but the global average surface temperature has warmed over the period 1997 to 2013, ocean heat content has increased significantly, and Arctic sea ice extent has declined, all showing clearly the continued warming of the climate system.,theageAustralia
,theageAustralia
Australia has just set a new record in 2013 for the hottest calendar year temperature averaged across the whole country, unprecedented in more than a hundred years of instrumental observations and outside the range that can be explained by natural variability alone.,theageAustralia

,theglobeandmail
The Profumo affair had all the makings of a British sex scandal - a middle-aged and married cabinet minister, a Russian spy and a 21-year-old call girl who was sleeping with both. When rumours of his trysts with Christine Keeler could no longer be ignored, John Profumo, the secretary of state for war, stood in Parliament and denied it. Ten weeks later, he admitted he had lied, and resigned, his confession eventually bringing down the government of Harold Macmillan. Yevgeny Ivanov, the Russian attaché, fled England before the scandal broke and was never proven to be a spy. But Keeler, in her 2013 book, admitted she ""betrayed her country"" by bedding Profumo to extract secrets about missile movements that were shared with the Cold War enemy. -Eric Atkins",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/photos/a.157369913903.114299.140961138903/10153302917438904/?type=3,6/5/2015 6:36,31,6,14,31,0,0,0,0,0,theglobeandmail

109808052412959_765400730187018,"Israel says it is appropriating 400 hectares of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank, possibly one of the biggest property takeovers for the Jewish state in decades. The Israeli military said it is declaring the land ""state-owned"" on orders from the country's political leaders, in response to the June killing of three Israeli teenagers who were kidnapped from a roadside near Bethlehem, in the southern area of the West Bank. ,bignewsnetwork
,bignewsnetwork
Israel has named three Palestinians from Hebron as the suspects in the killings that helped ignite the 50-day war with Hamas militants who control the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. The fighting was halted last week with an open-ended cease-fire, but the land appropriation drew an immediate rebuke from chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat. He called for diplomatic action against Israel, which he said is ""committing various crimes against the Palestinian people and their occupied land."",bignewsnetwork
Israel could create a new city called Gevaot on the land. A current settlement there has only 10 families.,bignewsnetwork
,bignewsnetwork
A spokesman for the anti-settlement group Peace Now, Yariv Oppenheimer, said the settlement expansion will hurt the chances for further Israeli peace negotiations with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. ""This new declaration of expansion of settlement by the Israeli government is very significant. We don't remember such a big announcement in the last one or two decades,"" said Oppenheimer. ""This is a stab in the back of Abbas and the moderate people in the Palestinian Authority. Instead of strengthening the Palestinian Authority versus Hamas, Israel is showing its harder side and actually in a unilateral move: expand settlement activity and destroy the chance for re-negotiation with the Palestinian Authority.'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been a staunch advocate for expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, land that Israel captured during the Six-Day War in 1967. Israel often has drawn condemnation, though, for its settlement expansion, which most countries consider illegal under international law. About 550,000 Israelis live among 2.4 million Palestinians in the West Bank and occupied east Jerusalem.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/bignewsnetwork/photos/a.524842704242823.1073741825.109808052412959/765400730187018/?type=3,8/31/2014 16:10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,bignewsnetwork
