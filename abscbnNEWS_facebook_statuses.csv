27254475167_10152179072230168,"June is traditionally known as the wedding month, but times have changed. Records today show that most Filipinos tie the knot, perhaps more appropriately, in February, which has always been celebrated as the love month. 

As old as mankind, as legendary as the Holy Grail, and as complex as the origin of the universe, love is the one emotion that almost always defies logic and pushes people to the extreme. Why do women fall for womanizers? Why do husbands go astray? Why do people fall in love and kill for love? 

Questions about love, falling in and out of love, are endless, much like its very definition.
In keeping with tradition, Cheche Lazaro Presents unravels this June the mystery of love through its ultimate manifestation -- marriage.

Broadcast journalist Cheche Lazaro takes a deeper look into the happy-ever-after promise – or goal -- of marriage and the very complexity of love as a science. Sharing their own experiences are celebrity couples Christian and Winnie Monsod, who have been together for 53 years, and newlyweds Boots Anson Roa and Francisco ""King"" Rodrigo, who are at it a second time.

Psychiatrist Ma. Luz Querubin, anthropologist Jonathan Taduran, and human sexuality expert and psychologist Agnes Bueno discuss the science and explain why the heart is the wrong symbolism for love. They redefine the common perceptions of love and explain how chemical processes in the brain – and our sense of smell -- can lead to falling in love.

Love advice expert Papa Jack and marriage councilor Pastor Herald Cruz provide the healthy boost on the intricacies of marriage and love.

This two-hour documentary special is a testimony of timeless, endless love bound by the sacrament of marriage. It is a road map to a bumpy and challenging but worth-keeping relationships as well.

Kapag Tumibok Ang Puso is not for the loveless to seek love or for those who are in love to veer away from it. It is for those who see, feel and know how it is to love, those who are willing to love and be loved.

Nine days of fighting in Zamboanga have left an indelible mark in the city that was once called a ""city of love.""

While many breathed a sigh of relief as dozens of hostages were secured from the conflict areas, a few stared off at a distance as they pondered what steps to take next.

For the soldiers, the war is not yet over and tougher days might still be ahead as they continue to hunt down the MNLF rebels .

For the residents of Zamboanga whose houses were destroyed, they would have to start again, hopefully, with a lot of help from the government and the private sector.

For the hostages who were caught in the crossfire, the sound of gunfire will likely linger in their memories.

Ladies and ladies at heart came in droves to see dozens of hunks show off their sexy bodies at this year's Cosmopolitan bachelor bash held at the World Trade Center last Tuesday, September 18.

While Paulo Avelino was supposed to headline the annual show dubbed as a ""shameless objectification of men,"" the ""Walang Hanggan"" actor was nowhere in sight, much to the dismay of the crowd.

The sheer number of males stripping down and throwing pieces of clothing during the bash, however, seemed to have more than made up for Avelino's absence, judging by the screams of the predominantly female audience.

Among the local celebrities who strutted down the runway of the Cosmo bachelor bash were Kapamilya stars JM de Guzman, James Blanco and Baron Geisler, collegiate basketball players Anthony and David Semerad, Azkals Aly Borromeo and Anton del Rosario, and models Daniel Matsunaga and Fabio Ide.

Jesse made everyone feel wanted. He simply treated everyone with respect.  

He had time for everybody except himself. 

Seldom do people pass away doing what they loved doing. Jesse passed away doing what he loved most: going home.

Jesse was not a perfect human being but he was a true human being who treated everyone as true as himself.

You have fared well in this life. Fare well in the next. Maraming salamat Jesse for being a true friend of the common people.

Demetrio C. Vicente has been called to the witness stand. He is testifying on the sale of seven parcels of land to him by Mrs. Corona.

Vicente is Chief Justice Renato Corona's second cousin. (His middle name is Coronado.)

Questioning revolving on tax payments and deeds of sale; Vicente said the title and absolute deed of sale is with him. However, the land is not registered in his name, so he is paying real estate taxes in Mrs. Corona's name.

Another interesting development: The prosecution raised the possibility that Vicente's deed of sale was not notarized by a registered notary. They showed a certification that the notary was not licensed in Makati City. Vicente was accompanied to the notary by Mrs. Corona.

Vicente, however, asserted that the land is his, and he has been the one paying taxes on it since he bought it in 1990.

Vicente still on the stand, recess called for the sound system in the Senate session hall to be fixed.

Rep. Tobias ""Toby"" Tiangco was questioned by Senator-judge Miriam Defensor Santiago on what his motivation was in testifying. Tiangco said he only wanted to prove he is telling the truth, to which Santiago responded he is ""too good to be true.""

Tiangco said he will not run for Senator, but will run for reelection in Navotas after he finishes his current term. He can run for two more terms. 

Memorable dialogue:
Tiangco: It's nothing personal. I don't want to offend anyone.
Santiago: Feel free to offend me if you want to.

Santiago to Tiangco: You'll end up either a hero in the public's eyes or a traitor in the eyes of your colleagues.

The defense's next witness was Araceli Bayuga, the Supreme Court's Chief Judicial Staff Officer. Bayuga is in charge of cash collection and disbursement in the SC. Her department handles compensation and taxation for SC employees, including the Chief Justice.

Bayuga presented alpha lists containing tax payment records of CJ Renato Corona from 2002-2005. She also presented a list of Corona's salaries from 2002-2011. 

According to a tweet by @Karen_Davila, ""Bayuga (enumerates ALL allowances of CJ Corona) - all paid payrolls of CJ Corona 2002-2011 - P21,636,781.45.""

Bayuga said aside from his salary, Corona incurred benefits such as for good productivity, rice allowance, Christmas bonus, etc.
